# Presentation Assignment - Neural Networks, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Transformers

**Assignment Overview:**
For our upcoming class, each of you is required to prepare a presentation on all of the following topics:
- Neural Networks
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Diffusion Models
- Transformers

**Presentation Details:**
- Date: Sunday, September 8
- Time Limit: 10 minutes per presentation

Although you will prepare for all four topics, you will only be asked to present on one topic during class. The topic you will present on will be assigned randomly on the day of the presentation.

Please ensure your presentation on each topic is clear, concise, and informative. This is a great opportunity to deepen your understanding of these key concepts in AI and machine learning.

Once you have prepared your presentations, please upload them to Google Classroom by the end of Saturday, September 7th 2024. If you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to reach out.
