# Fundamentals of Generative AI - Assignment 01

**Assignment Overview:**
Summarize any one of the following topics in your own words:

- Differentiate between AI, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and applied AI.
- Define Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and outline the five steps to achieve super intelligence.
- Explain the concepts of training and inference in AI, and describe how GPUs or neural engines are utilized for these tasks.
- Describe neural networks, including an explanation of parameters and tokens.
- Provide an overview of Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- Clarify what Large Language Models (LLMs) are, compare open-source and closed-source LLMs, and discuss how LLMs can produce hallucinations.
- Explain models, multimodal and foundation models, also discuss how they can be fine-tuned.
- Identify the key differences between CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs, and explain the major distinctions between x86 and ARM microprocessors.
